    "# Hamper Problem - Solving with a Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook details using a Genetic Algoritm to solve the \"Hamper Problem\" (described below). A Genetic Algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm modelled after natural selection that can be used to solve optimization and search problems among other use. The problem that I'll be solving was proposed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A charity purchased some bulk packs, each pack contains 1 or more items. They want to put together as many hampers as they can, with the costs ideally of 5000, and they're all as even as possible, so minimise the sum of the absolute difference of the hamper cost to 5000 across all hampers. Design the hampers with no duplicate items.\n",

    "## Problem outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my summary of the problem based on the provided information. There are some points that I would want to discuss/clarify in a real world scenario, but I have made assumptions for these for the purpose of solving the problem here.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Goals:__\n",
    "* Make multiple hampers from the items in the bulk packs\n",
    "* Minimise the sum of the absolute difference from 5000 for the total cost of the hampers \n",
    "* Maximise the number of hampers (I'm assuming the above always takes priority, so this is really a moot point)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Constraints:__\n",
    "* Hampers cannot contain duplicate items\n",
    "* Limited to the number of units specified in the data (i.e. can't exceed this)\n",
    "* All items must be used (assumed)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Output:__\n",
    "* Number of hampers (have already calculated the optimum number to be 25)\n",
    "* Sum of the absolute difference of hamper cost from 5000 across all hampers (we'll refer to this as sum cost difference from here on for brevity)\n",
